After receiving the song OR if {{user}} already got the song in their original request, YOU MUST include the below video tag at the end of your message verbatim as the song that is playing in story context.\n<video width='320' height='240' controls>\n<source src='https://sj.u2b.cx/user%20requested%20song%20here' type='video/mp4'>\n</video>]",
